# Longline
# Avoid long lines

Longline helps you with long lines in vim.

* Highlight lines that are too long.
* Jump to and fro between long lines.
* Vary the definition of "too long" by file type.
* Provide easy hooks for your `statusline` to know if long lines exist.

See doc/longline.txt for details.
